                  <h3>Welcome EveryOne</h3>
                  <p align="justify">Welcome to my website. My name is Mr. Biwas Pudasaini, and I was born and raised in Kathmandu.

                  <p align="justify">
                    "As an individual, I have a wide range of interests and passions. One of my favourite hobbies is travelling. I find great joy in discovering new cities and places around the world, and often save up for months to plan a trip every year. I enjoy going on trips with friends and family, but I find that solo travelling brings me the greatest adventure and thrill. Exploring new places on my own gives me a sense of freedom and self-reliance that I find truly exhilarating.<br>

Another passion of mine is volunteering. Since my college days, I have been associated with a few non-profit organizations and I like to spend my weekends helping these NGOs with various activities. From teaching to organizing fun games and activities, I enjoy making learning fun for underprivileged kids. I believe that giving back to the community is an important way of making a positive impact on the world around us.<br>

In my free time, I also enjoy playing football. This sport not only helps me unwind and relax, but it also helps boost my creativity and analytical thinking skills. The combination of physical activity and mental focus required for the game makes it the perfect way for me to de-stress and feel refreshed.<br>

Overall, I am a well-rounded individual with a wide range of interests and passions. From travelling to volunteering, from playing football to pursuing my education, I am always looking for new ways to challenge myself and grow as a person. I am highly dedicated and hardworking, and I am always looking to improve myself and make a positive impact on the world around me.”<br> <br> <br> <br>
